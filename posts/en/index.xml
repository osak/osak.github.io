      <description>I participated in ICFP Content 2021 with regular teammates. Our team name was &amp;ldquo;manarimo&amp;rdquo;, which is what we&amp;rsquo;ve been using for years recently.
 Repository： https://github.com/manarimo/ICFPC2021/ Portal website： http://icfpc2021-manarimo.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/best.html Manual solver： http://icfpc2021-manarimo.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/kenkoooo/#/problem/1  We ranked at the second place as of when the scoreboard was frozen. I&amp;rsquo;m happy with this result as we are #1 among Japanese teams. I was thinking we could get the global #1, however, RGBTeam did a better job then us.</description>
